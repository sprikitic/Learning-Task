                <h2> Dont Kill Yourself Living For Others </h2>
                <h4>(By:Nsikak Andrew)</h4> <br><br>
                <p>Never make a disadvantage of your life,
                   While trying to make others happy.<br><br>
                   Let family problems to be by their self,
                   If you must solve it, let it be at your time;
                   If you carry them as your problem,
                   You might live never to solve yours.<br><br>
                   It is not everybody you should carry along,
                   Those who agreed with your ideals you should carry;
                   But those who don’t find a way to keep them off.<br><br>
                   Every problem from home, let them be at home,
                   And those at the workplace, let remain there;
                   If you seem to carry them all along,
                   Then remember that you’re digging a slow grave
                   That might in the long run consume you in no time.<br><br>
